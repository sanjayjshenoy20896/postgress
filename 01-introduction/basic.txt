The commands in psql is done using psql shell

The commands can be written in upper case or lowercase.
It is generally preffered to follow upper case as some sql providers follow uppercase only
Listing of databases:
The listing of databases is done using "\l" command in the Terminal

Creating a database:
A new database can be created using the below command with a meaningfull name.
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>
Or 
create database <database_name>

Deleting a database:

To view the list of commands using help cmd:
psql --help

Connecting to database using the terminal:
Syntax: psql -h <hostname> -p <portno> -U <username> <dbname>
eg:  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres test

on the psql terminal: (helps in switching between dbs)
\c <dbname>


Data Types:

how to create a table in database:
The table in a databse in create using the keyword CREATE TABLE.
SYNTAX:
CREATE TABLE <table_name>{
    column_name + datatype + constrainta if any
}

eg:

CREATE TABLE person{
    id int,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    date_of_birth TIMESTAMP
};

a.) creating table without constraints
CREATE TABLE person(
    id int,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    date_of_birth TIMESTAMP

);

b.) creating table with constraints

CREATE TABLE person (
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, // autoincrement , value cannot be null, plus a primary key for the table
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, // value cannot be null
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,// value cannot be null
    gender VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL, // value cannot be null
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL // value cannot be null
);

Insert record(s) into the table:
The data records can be entered into the table using the INSERT INTO
Syntax:
INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name to add data>) values (<actual data record values>);
each value is seperated by "," comma
eg:
INSERT INTO person (first_name,last_name,gender,date_of_birth) values ('Anne','Smith','FEMALE',DATE '1998-01-09');

INSERT INTO person (first_name,last_name,gender,date_of_birth,email) values ('Jake','Jones','MALE',DATE '1998-01-10',jake@gmail.com);


Bulk insert using Mockaroo -> This is a website used to generate data mock data as per schema requirements
generate data as per need:

sql file
 F:/postgress/01-introduction/person.sql

\i F:/postgress/01-introduction/car.sql;

SELECT FROM:
it is a basic command for quering for information.
select * from person
* -> used to get all fields from the table
we can also specify the names of columns as per need.

ORDER BY: Sortung operation:
eg: SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth ASC;

if condition of ORDER BY not mentioned, then it is asecending by default
ASC OR DESC

DISTINCT:
To find unique column values -> "DISTINCT <column_name>"
eg: SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth ASC;

WHERE CLAUSE , AND operation:
WHERE -> Used to mention the specific fields with a value
AND -> used for comnbing the conditions of 2 or more values

Comparison operation: (bitwise and logical operation)
=,<,<=,>,>=
<> -> not equal

LIMIT, OFFSET AND FETCH

EG:
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 5;

SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5;

SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 15 ROW ONLY; -> This is used to fetch users form n+1 index anmd get the next n rows;

IN:
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China','Portugal');

it is used to query for information for a list (array) of values;

Between:(Range of values);

SELECT * FROM person WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND '2025-01-01';

LIKE and iLIKE:
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%hc360.com';
 SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '_____@%';


SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth iLIKE  'ch%';
Above cmd gets the records whose country_of_birth starts with ch as case in-sensitive


- -> there many chars before and after
%-> multiple chars before and after

GROUP BY

SELECT country_of_birth,COUNT(*) from person GROUP BY country_of_birth;
Above cmd is used for grouping operation and finding the total for each


GROUP BY HAVING:
SELECT country_of_birth,COUNT(*) from person GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT (*) > 5 ORDER BY country_of_birth;


Calculating MAX,MIN and average:
MAX: SELECT MAX(price) from car;
MIN: SELECT MIN(price) from car;
AVERAGE: SELECT AVERAGE(price) from car;
ROUND: SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) from car;

SCENARIOS:
1.) min,max and AVG,count car price for each make and model combination
SELECT make,model,MIN(price),MAX(price),AVG(price) FROM car GROUP BY make,model;
SELECT make,MIN(price),MAX(price),AVG(price),count(*) FROM car GROUP BY make;

SUM:
SELECT make,SUM(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;

COALESCE: find a default value if null

NULLIF: used to prevent divison by zero

Timestamps and Date:
