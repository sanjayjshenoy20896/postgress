Relationship / Foriegn keys:
The scenario we are looking at it is as follows with the existing tables for person and car
1.) Person has car
2.) Person can have one car
3.) Car can belong to one person only


This can be achived by using relationship between tables.

In our person table , we cab create a foreign key which references the car id in the person
So here the car_id becomes the foreign key in the person table

Foriegn Key:
key is column that references a primary key of another table in the current table.

Adding relationship between tables:
create table car (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	make VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	price NUMERIC(19, 2) NOT NULL
);

create table person (
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	gender VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(100),
	date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
	country_of_birth VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	car_id BIGINT REFERENCES car (id),
	UNIQUE(car_id)
);

Updating Foriegn keys columns can be done by using UPDATE cmd with value for id


Joins:
TABLE A:
TABLE B:

inner joins: it is used to take data from 2 tables and give common data elements
A intersection B = C -> VIRTUAL TABLE C
SELECT * FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id;

\x -> expanded display per r

Left joins:
combines all rows from left table id and records from table b with corresponding relationship as well as those not having the relationship.
SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id;


provided left over from intersection:
SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id WHERE car.* is NULL;


DELETE records with foriegn keys;
