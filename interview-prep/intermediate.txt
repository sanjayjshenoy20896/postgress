Intermediate questions:

1.) Difference between primary key and foriegn key?
foriegn key -> It is actually a primary key in another table. This key might be a NULL or NOT NULL.
primary key -> It is actually a unique constraint in a table. This cannot be a null value.

13.) Multi-version Concurrency Control:
This means that while querying a database each transaction sees a snapshot of data (a database version) as it was some time ago, regardless of the current state of the underlying data.


14.) Main operators:
The main types of operators available in PostgreSQL are:

Arithmetic operators
Logical operators
Comparison operators
Bitwise operators

15.) Indexes
An index is a special data structure related to a table and used for storing its important parts and enabling faster data search and retrieval.

16.) Partitioning in PSQL:
It’s the process of splitting a large table into smaller pieces


17.) Write-Ahead Logging 
This is used to maintain any writeing operation to a table in a database in a write transaction log.
This helps in maintaining database in case of database or system failure.

18.) Difference types of Joins
In PostgreSQL, the main joins are:

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

19.) Function - Stored procedures
This allows you to wrap in several queries together in a single procedure which would take multiple queries in any scenario.

20.) View:
It is a virtual result of a query that combines results of 2 or more tables.
